# edge-and-corner-detection
Edge detection and corner detection of an image.

Edge Detection
* Implements convolution process of smoothing the image with a 5 x 5 Gaussian Filter with \sigma = 1 and 2
* Implements convolution process of convolving a 3 x 3 Sobel filters with the output images obtained using the Gaussian Filter
* Implements convolution process of convolving the image with the Gaussian derivative filters (5 x 5 filters and for \sigma = 1 and 2)

Corner Detection
* Implements Harris Corner Detection algorithm

## Run project
